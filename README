A simple wallpaper slideshow for the nitrogen wallpaper thingy (I am rather profecional arn't I).
Made for crunchbang but it should work on debian and ubuntu if they user nitrogen that is.
I user conky to change it hourly but it could be done anyway that can run a command at a set interval
(or not set I suppose).

My conky to change it is like this

wallpaper $alignr ${exec rotate-wallpaper -c} / ${exec rotate-wallpaper -t}
${execi 3600 rotate-wallpaper}

The first line is not needed and just displays the current wallpaper out of the total. The second line is
where stuff starts to happen, it calls the command every 3600 seconds (an hour unless my maths is even
worse than I though (quite possible)).

To use it you either need to run it as a bash script or put it somewhere in your path for bash to find it
and execute it. On crunchbang put it in the bin folder in your home directory and run the following command
from home.

chmod +x bin/rotate-wallpaper

That makes the file executable so that it can be run by typing its name or ./rotate-wallpaper from where it is
(in this case ~/bin).

This script is a heavily modified version of the script found here http://crunchbanglinux.org/pastebin/235
