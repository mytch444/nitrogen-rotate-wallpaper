A simple wallpaper slideshow for the nitrogen wallpaper thingy.
I use conky to change it hourly but it could be done anyway that can run a command at a set interval.
In conky add the following lines 

wallpaper $alignr ${exec rotate-wallpaper -c} / ${exec rotate-wallpaper -t}
${execi 3600 rotate-wallpaper}

The first line is not needed and just displays the current wallpaper out of the total. The second line is
where stuff starts to happen, it calls the command every 3600 seconds (an hour unless my maths is even
worse than I though (quite possible)).
