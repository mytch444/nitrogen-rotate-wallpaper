RotateWallpaper
===============

A simple wallpaper slideshow for the nitrogen (now feh, edit rotatewallpaper to change) 
wallpaper that goes with conky and changes its text color to white or black depending 
on the brighness of the wallpaper.

The rotatewallpaper script is a heavily modified version of the script found here
(http://crunchbanglinux.org/pastebin/235).

Installaion
-----------

You will need java for image brightness and javac to compile it.

Run:
    $ make # You will likely need to edit the make file and change your java compiler (javac should would but slackwares funny)
    $ make install
  

Then add the following to your ~/.conkyrc to rotate your wallpaper every hour and set the
text color.

${execi 3600 rotate-wallpaper} # rotate wallpaper every 3600 seconds (an hour)
${execp conkytextcolor} # set the text color to what is most likely to work best.
