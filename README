A simple wallpaper slideshow for the nitrogen wallpaper that goes with conky and changes its text 
color to white or black depending on the brighness of the wallpaper.

Add the following to your .conkyrc to rotate your wallpaper every hour

${execi 3600 rotate-wallpaper} # rotate wallpaper every 3600 seconds (an hour)
${execp conkytextcolor} # set the text color to what is most likely to work best.

The rotatewallpaper script is a heavily modified version of the script found here
